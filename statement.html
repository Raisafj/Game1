      <h1>
        Timtim's First Date
      </h1>

      <p>by Ayesha Siddiki and Raisa Jahan</p>

      <h2>COLUMNS LIST:</h2>
      <b>
        <u>Column A:</u> We chose a combination of both playful based art and a
        game.
      </b>
      <br /><br />

      <b
        ><u>Column B:</u> We were interested in developing game-like ideas
        around Column B's Option 2, (Entry 1 of 2) 7a (Merriam-webster's 7th
        definition, sub-definition a, "the stage representation of an action or
        story" and Option 2, (from entry 2 of 2) 4a (Merriam-webster's 4th
        definition, sub-definition a, "to engage or take part in a game"
      </b>
      <br /><br />

      <b
        ><u>Column C:</u> .The game will not only tell a story but also the
        emotion the character is feeling and within that story he has to follow
        a series of rules to reach his goal which is to reach his date. Anthropy
        argues that “The experience we call a game is created by the
        interactions between different rules, but the rules themselves aren’t
        the game, the interaction is! A game can’t exist without a player or
        players: someone needs to be engaging with the rules for the experience
        to happen.” Hence, the rules are not the game but TimTim’s interaction
        with the rules is what makes it a game.

      <br /><br />

      <b><u>Column D:</u> We took page-Oriented approach with 10 pages. .</b>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>Artist's Statement:</h2>

      <b
        >Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the non-living things
        could express how they feel! Timtim’s first date is a playful art piece
        where the player helps Timtim the main character of the game to reach
        his date, Cece. Our main goal was to show a romantic yet an adventurous
        day in a non-living thing’s life. </b
      ><br /><br />
      <b
        >Like every other day Timtim was sleeping forgetting he has a date .
        Cece’s texts wakes him up and he rushes his way out. As he rushes, he
        breaks his glass so the players need to help him remember his things
        from his memory as he cannot see without his glasses. In closet.html
        player needs to match each pair to get Timtim ready for his date. In
        page findCar.html Timtim walks towards his car. He needs to drive safely
        without hitting 1500 miles safely without hitting another car in
        carGame.html to reach the next stop. On his way he remembered he forgot
        flowers. He looks for a garden in findGarden.html and collects flowers
        for Cece in flowers.html.</b
