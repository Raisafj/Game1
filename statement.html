      <h1>
        Timtim's First Date
      </h1>

      <p>by Ayesha Siddiki and Raisa Jahan</p>

      <h2>COLUMNS LIST:</h2>
      <b>
        <u>Column A:</u> We chose a combination of both playful based art and a
        game.
      </b>
      <br /><br />

      <b
        ><u>Column B:</u> We were interested in developing game-like ideas
        around Column B's Option 2, (Entry 1 of 2) 7a (Merriam-webster's 7th
        definition, sub-definition a, "the stage representation of an action or
        story" and Option 2, (from entry 2 of 2) 4a (Merriam-webster's 4th
        definition, sub-definition a, "to engage or take part in a game"
      </b>
      <br /><br />

      <b
        ><u>Column C:</u> .The game will not only tell a story but also the
        emotion the character is feeling and within that story he has to follow
        a series of rules to reach his goal which is to reach his date. Anthropy
        argues that “The experience we call a game is created by the
        interactions between different rules, but the rules themselves aren’t
        the game, the interaction is! A game can’t exist without a player or
        players: someone needs to be engaging with the rules for the experience
        to happen.” Hence, the rules are not the game but TimTim’s interaction
        with the rules is what makes it a game.
      </b>
      <br /><br />

      <b><u>Column D:</u> We took page-Oriented approach with 10 pages. .</b>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>Artist's Statement:</h2>

      <b
        >TimTim and his first date is an adventurous browser-game, built with
        HTML/CSS and JavaScript. We are taking a story-based game approach where
        the player TimTim) needs to reach his first date before she leaves the
        restaurant. To reach her, he has to complete a series of tasks, if not,
        she leaves and TimTim’s first date is ruined, and loses the game.
