      <h1>
        Timtim's First Date
      </h1>

      <p>by Ayesha Siddiki and Raisa Jahan</p>

      <h2>COLUMNS LIST:</h2>
      <b>
        <u>Column A:</u> We chose a combination of both playful based art and a
        game.
      </b>
      <br /><br />

      <b
        ><u>Column B:</u> We were interested in developing game-like ideas
        around Column B's Option 2, (Entry 1 of 2) 7a (Merriam-webster's 7th
        definition, sub-definition a, "the stage representation of an action or
        story" and Option 2, (from entry 2 of 2) 4a (Merriam-webster's 4th
        definition, sub-definition a, "to engage or take part in a game"
      </b>
      <br /><br />

      <b
        ><u>Column C:</u> .The game will not only tell a story but also the
        emotion the character is feeling and within that story he has to follow
        a series of rules to reach his goal which is to reach his date. Anthropy
        argues that “The experience we call a game is created by the
        interactions between different rules, but the rules themselves aren’t
        the game, the interaction is! A game can’t exist without a player or
        players: someone needs to be engaging with the rules for the experience
        to happen.” Hence, the rules are not the game but TimTim’s interaction
        with the rules is what makes it a game.

      <br /><br />

      <b><u>Column D:</u> We took page-Oriented approach with 10 pages. .</b>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>Artist's Statement:</h2>

      <b>
        TimTim and his first date are discussed through our work. It's an
        adventurous game and a playful piece of art where we follow TimTim and
        his very first date! TimTim did the same, much as we all made mistakes
        when we went on our first date. What was his mistake, then? So what is
        his mistake? TimTim overslept and forgot about his date and it’s on our
        hand to help him reach Cece - his date - on time before she gets mad and
        leaves. </b
      ><br /><br />
      <b>
        In the beginning, we see Cece texting him, concerned if he’s coming on the date or not as he’s not replying and is already. 
        She was disappointed however, we wake him up and help him get ready but accidents don’t leave TimTim alone so soon. 
        We move on to the next page which is closet.html where TimTim breaks his glasses due to the rush. 
        So now,  he can barely see and needs to get ready as soon as possible and the only way to get ready is by remembering where he 
        kept his things - this introduces us to the memory game in the closet where TimTim has to find pair of each of his 
        objects by remembering to continue.  After TimTim is ready we take him to the car. Once he’s in the car we have to 
        help TimTim drive 1500 miles safely in carGame.html to reach his next stop. Like I said before, accidents don’t leave 
        TimTim alone so soon - midway he realizes he forgot flowers for Cece luckily he finds a garden and has to collect it in 
        flowers.html, and only then he can reach his date, Cece. We have also added a map for players to enjoy the games individually 
        without playing as the series we planned. They can skip to each of these games - cargame.html, closet.html, and flowers.html - and 
        moreover helps the players to navigate.
      </b>
      <br> <br>
      <b>
      Our goal was to have an adventurous game and take the users on a TimTim’s journey. 
        We wanted to have a story within the game. It is light-hearted, playful, and slightly 
        romantic for kids and teenagers to play. Our inspiration for this game was “Purble place” that we 
        believe almost every Windows desktop user has come across. Purble Place is a collection of single-player, 
        strategy games which are developed by Oberon Games.
